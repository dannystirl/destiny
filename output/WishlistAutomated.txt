//item 768621510: Deliverance
//notes:Deliverance is a one-of-a-kind with an incredible suite of perks. It's difficult to recommend something specific, as there's a great deal of synergistic perk options here. Compulsive/Chill Clip is a Reservoir Burst-esque combo, without detrimentally increasing mag size. Cornered/Surrounded is a godly combo that cuts down Charge Time and massively increases damage output (Enhanced Surrounded + Spec is an ENORMOUS +47% buff), Demolitionist/Adrenaline Junkie have natural synergy, along with Demo/Chill Clip, Heating Up/Tap the Trigger, Perpetual Motion for consistency... Almost anything works here. Invest in getting that Charge Time down as far as you can while maintaining Range and bolt spread (Stability). |tags:god-pve

//notes:Deliverance is our first kinetic legendary fusion rifle. [...] Much like the rest of this season, you want to craft one with arrowhead brake to get that recoil direction up. Slotting just a counterbalance mod would suffice but you lose out on all the spec mods or backup mag. I think harmony or adrenaline junkie are going to be your best perks for general utility and major killing. But chill clip in conjunction with stasis builds will be really strong together. Recommended MW - Reload. |tags:pve,mkb,controller

I think harmony or adrenaline junkie are going to be your best perks for general utility and major killing. But chill clip in conjunction with stasis builds will be really strong together.

The first fusion rifle for your kinetic slot, with perfect recoil direction from the precision subtype intrinsic perk. Your choice of barrel and mag, but you might want stability to keep bolts together, or charge time to get your shots away as quickly as possible. Demolitionist and Adrenaline Junkie pair well, and help stasis builds. Recommended MW: Charge Time or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag or damage-boosting (Minor, Major or Taken Spec) mod.

//notes:PvP first choice roll for duelling (3s). Strong subtype with vertical recoil, very good stats, and very good perk combinations from the first ever legendary stasis (kinetic slot) fusion rifle. Looking to get Range to 80 and Stability to 70 with barrel and mag traits, so the boosts from Perpetual Motion and Tap the Trigger get you to 90 stability in use. Recommended MW: Range or Stability with Quick Access Sling or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on play style. Deliverance is a one-of-a-kind with an incredible suite of perks. It's difficult to recommend something specific, as there's a great deal of synergistic perk options here. Compulsive/Chill Clip is a Reservoir Burst-esque combo, without detrimentally increasing mag size.

Strong subtype with vertical recoil, very good stats, and very good perk combinations from the first ever legendary stasis (kinetic slot) fusion rifle.

//notes:Deliverance is our first kinetic legendary fusion rifle. [...] Much like the rest of this season, you want to craft one with arrowhead brake to get that recoil direction up. Slotting just a counterbalance mod would suffice but you lose out on all the spec mods or backup mag. I think harmony or adrenaline junkie are going to be your best perks for general utility and major killing. But chill clip in conjunction with stasis builds will be really strong together.

//notes:PvP first choice roll for chaining (6s). Strong subtype with vertical recoil, very good stats, and very good perk combinations from the first ever legendary stasis (kinetic slot) fusion rifle. Looking to get both Range to 80 and Stability to 70 with Masterwork, barrel, and mag traits. Just pick up one special brick (preferably with a Fusion Scavenger) to proc Chill Clip - just one bolt, even at range, will proc the slowing field detonation, and Cornered helps with follow-up kills for anyone close by caught in the slowing field. Recommended MW: Range or Stability with Quick Access Sling or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on play style. Deliverance is a one-of-a-kind with an incredible suite of perks. It's difficult to recommend something specific, as there's a great deal of synergistic perk options here. Compulsive/Chill Clip is a Reservoir Burst-esque combo, without detrimentally increasing mag size. Cornered/Surrounded is a godly combo that cuts down Charge Time and massively increases damage output (Enhanced Surrounded + Spec is an ENORMOUS +47% buff), Demolitionist/Adrenaline Junkie have natural synergy, along with Demo/Chill Clip, Heating Up/Tap the Trigger, Perpetual Motion for consistency... Almost anything works here. Invest in getting that Charge Time down as far as you can while maintaining Range and bolt spread (Stability). |tags:god-pve

//notes:Deliverance is a one-of-a-kind with an incredible suite of perks. It's difficult to recommend something specific, as there's a great deal of synergistic perk options here. Compulsive/Chill Clip is a Reservoir Burst-esque combo, without detrimentally increasing mag size. Cornered/Surrounded is a godly combo that cuts down Charge Time and massively increases damage output (Enhanced Surrounded + Spec is an ENORMOUS +47% buff), Demolitionist/Adrenaline Junkie have natural synergy, along with Demo/Chill Clip, Heating Up/Tap the Trigger, Perpetual Motion for consistency... Almost anything works here. Invest in getting that Charge Time down as far as you can while maintaining Range and bolt spread (Stability). |tags:god-pve

//notes:Shapeable through the Mars Relic. PvE first choice roll for end-game content. The first fusion rifle for your kinetic slot, with perfect recoil direction from the precision subtype intrinsic perk. Your choice of barrel and mag, but you might want stability to keep bolts together, or charge time to get your shots away as quickly as possible. Cornered and Surrounded pair well, giving a 40% damage boost (or 47% boost for the enhanced perk) when used with a Surrounded Spec mod. Recommended MW: Charge Time or Reload Speed, with a Surrounded Spec mod. |tags:pve

I think harmony or adrenaline junkie are going to be your best perks for general utility and major killing. But chill clip in conjunction with stasis builds will be really strong together. Recommended MW - Reload. For PvP Deliverance is more of a kinetic Likely Suspect than it is a kinetic Main Ingredient. That being said, it does now allow players the ability to use other weapons and create some loadout diversity. Demolitionist and tap the trigger are extremely strong pairings together. Successful warm-up is also good if you want to go on sprees, but the consistency of tap the trigger (even post nerf) is hard to pass up. Recommended MW - Stability. |tags:pvp,pve,mkb,controller

//item 2943293195: Deliverance (Adept)
//notes:Deliverance is a one-of-a-kind with an incredible suite of perks. It's difficult to recommend something specific, as there's a great deal of synergistic perk options here. Compulsive/Chill Clip is a Reservoir Burst-esque combo, without detrimentally increasing mag size. Cornered/Surrounded is a godly combo that cuts down Charge Time and massively increases damage output (Enhanced Surrounded + Spec is an ENORMOUS +47% buff), Demolitionist/Adrenaline Junkie have natural synergy, along with Demo/Chill Clip, Heating Up/Tap the Trigger, Perpetual Motion for consistency... Almost anything works here. Invest in getting that Charge Time down as far as you can while maintaining Range and bolt spread (Stability). |tags:god-pve

//notes:PvP first choice roll for duelling (3s). Strong subtype with vertical recoil, very good stats, and very good perk combinations from the first ever legendary stasis (kinetic slot) fusion rifle. Looking to get Range to 80 and Stability to 70 with barrel and mag traits, so the boosts from Perpetual Motion and Tap the Trigger get you to 90 stability in use. Recommended MW: Range or Stability with Quick Access Sling or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on play style. Deliverance is a one-of-a-kind with an incredible suite of perks. It's difficult to recommend something specific, as there's a great deal of synergistic perk options here. Compulsive/Chill Clip is a Reservoir Burst-esque combo, without detrimentally increasing mag size. Cornered/Surrounded is a godly combo that cuts down Charge Time and massively increases damage output (Enhanced Surrounded + Spec is an ENORMOUS +47% buff), Demolitionist/Adrenaline Junkie have natural synergy, along with Demo/Chill Clip, Heating Up/Tap the Trigger, Perpetual Motion for consistency... Almost anything works here. Invest in getting that Charge Time down as far as you can while maintaining Range and bolt spread (Stability). |tags:god-pve

//notes:PvP first choice roll for duelling (3s). Strong subtype with vertical recoil, very good stats, and very good perk combinations from the first ever legendary stasis (kinetic slot) fusion rifle. Going all in to range to get an extra metre to the damage falloff, and using the boosts from Perpetual Motion and Tap the Trigger get you to 77 stability in use.

That being said, it does now allow players the ability to use other weapons and create some loadout diversity. Demolitionist and tap the trigger are extremely strong pairings together. Successful warm-up is also good if you want to go on sprees, but the consistency of tap the trigger (even post nerf) is hard to pass up. Recommended MW - Stability. Deliverance is a one-of-a-kind with an incredible suite of perks. It's difficult to recommend something specific, as there's a great deal of synergistic perk options here. Compulsive/Chill Clip is a Reservoir Burst-esque combo, without detrimentally increasing mag size. Cornered/Surrounded is a godly combo that cuts down Charge Time and massively increases damage output (Enhanced Surrounded + Spec is an ENORMOUS +47% buff), Demolitionist/Adrenaline Junkie have natural synergy, along with Demo/Chill Clip, Heating Up/Tap the Trigger, Perpetual Motion for consistency... Almost anything works here. Invest in getting that Charge Time down as far as you can while maintaining Range and bolt spread (Stability). |tags:pvp,mkb,god-pve,controller

Looking to get both Range to 80 and Stability to 70 with Masterwork, barrel, and mag traits. Cornered gives you Backup Plan-lite when near enemies, and Successful Warm-Up makes follow-up kills easier. Recommended MW: Range with Quick Access Sling or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on play style. Deliverance is a one-of-a-kind with an incredible suite of perks. It's difficult to recommend something specific, as there's a great deal of synergistic perk options here. Compulsive/Chill Clip is a Reservoir Burst-esque combo, without detrimentally increasing mag size. Cornered/Surrounded is a godly combo that cuts down Charge Time and massively increases damage output (Enhanced Surrounded + Spec is an ENORMOUS +47% buff), Demolitionist/Adrenaline Junkie have natural synergy, along with Demo/Chill Clip, Heating Up/Tap the Trigger, Perpetual Motion for consistency... Almost anything works here. Invest in getting that Charge Time down as far as you can while maintaining Range and bolt spread (Stability). |tags:god-pve

//notes:For PvP Deliverance is more of a kinetic Likely Suspect than it is a kinetic Main Ingredient. That being said, it does now allow players the ability to use other weapons and create some loadout diversity. Demolitionist and tap the trigger are extremely strong pairings together. Successful warm-up is also good if you want to go on sprees, but the consistency of tap the trigger (even post nerf) is hard to pass up. Recommended MW - Stability.

//notes:Deliverance is our first kinetic legendary fusion rifle. [...] Much like the rest of this season, you want to craft one with arrowhead brake to get that recoil direction up. Slotting just a counterbalance mod would suffice but you lose out on all the spec mods or backup mag. I think harmony or adrenaline junkie are going to be your best perks for general utility and major killing. But chill clip in conjunction with stasis builds will be really strong together. Recommended MW - Reload. |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:PvP first choice roll for chaining (6s). Strong subtype with vertical recoil, very good stats, and very good perk combinations from the first ever legendary stasis (kinetic slot) fusion rifle. Looking to get both Range to 80 and Stability to 70 with Masterwork, barrel, and mag traits. Just pick up one special brick (preferably with a Fusion Scavenger) to proc Chill Clip - just one bolt, even at range, will proc the slowing field detonation, and Cornered helps with follow-up kills for anyone close by caught in the slowing field. Recommended MW: Range or Stability with Quick Access Sling or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on play style. Deliverance is a one-of-a-kind with an incredible suite of perks. It's difficult to recommend something specific, as there's a great deal of synergistic perk options here. Compulsive/Chill Clip is a Reservoir Burst-esque combo, without detrimentally increasing mag size. Cornered/Surrounded is a godly combo that cuts down Charge Time and massively increases damage output (Enhanced Surrounded + Spec is an ENORMOUS +47% buff), Demolitionist/Adrenaline Junkie have natural synergy, along with Demo/Chill Clip, Heating Up/Tap the Trigger, Perpetual Motion for consistency... Almost anything works here. Invest in getting that Charge Time down as far as you can while maintaining Range and bolt spread (Stability). |tags:god-pve

//notes:Shapeable through the Mars Relic. PvE backup roll for end-game content. The first fusion rifle for your kinetic slot, with perfect recoil direction from the precision subtype intrinsic perk. Your choice of barrel and mag, but you might want stability to keep bolts together, or charge time to get your shots away as quickly as possible. Chill Clip gives you a kind of stasis version of Reservoir Burst, and Compulsive Reloader helps with keeping the mag full. Recommended MW: Charge Time or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag or damage-boosting (Minor, Major or Taken Spec) mod.

Cornered/Surrounded is a godly combo that cuts down Charge Time and massively increases damage output (Enhanced Surrounded + Spec is an ENORMOUS +47% buff), Demolitionist/Adrenaline Junkie have natural synergy, along with Demo/Chill Clip, Heating Up/Tap the Trigger, Perpetual Motion for consistency... Almost anything works here. Invest in getting that Charge Time down as far as you can while maintaining Range and bolt spread (Stability). |tags:god-pve

Your choice of barrel and mag, but you might want stability to keep bolts together, or charge time to get your shots away as quickly as possible.

//notes:For PvP Deliverance is more of a kinetic Likely Suspect than it is a kinetic Main Ingredient. That being said, it does now allow players the ability to use other weapons and create some loadout diversity. Demolitionist and tap the trigger are extremely strong pairings together. Successful warm-up is also good if you want to go on sprees, but the consistency of tap the trigger (even post nerf) is hard to pass up. Recommended MW - Stability. |tags:pvp,mkb,controller

I think harmony or adrenaline junkie are going to be your best perks for general utility and major killing. But chill clip in conjunction with stasis builds will be really strong together.

//notes:For PvP Deliverance is more of a kinetic Likely Suspect than it is a kinetic Main Ingredient. That being said, it does now allow players the ability to use other weapons and create some loadout diversity. Demolitionist and tap the trigger are extremely strong pairings together. Successful warm-up is also good if you want to go on sprees, but the consistency of tap the trigger (even post nerf) is hard to pass up. Recommended MW - Stability. |tags:pvp,mkb,controller

//notes:Deliverance is our first kinetic legendary fusion rifle. [...] Much like the rest of this season, you want to craft one with arrowhead brake to get that recoil direction up. Slotting just a counterbalance mod would suffice but you lose out on all the spec mods or backup mag. I think harmony or adrenaline junkie are going to be your best perks for general utility and major killing. But chill clip in conjunction with stasis builds will be really strong together.

//notes:For PvP linear fusions can be hit or miss (zing), they require either set up for OHK, or to lower the charge time to treat it more like a sniper. Cataclysm can get the latter to a very strong degree. Accelerated coils, charge time MW, and successful warm up will net you such a fast charge time. And with linear fusion rifles being one shot kills to the head you can have a linear that is basically a sniper rifle after that first kill. You know what? Just use a sniper rifle.

//notes:Cataclysmic is an interesting linear fusion rifle [...] While it doesnt directly beat out Reeds Regret in terms of damage it possibly could. It really depends on your damage window. Firing line will do longer burst damage, but if you dont have mag extending perks you wont be able to keep up with Cataclysmic. Fourth times the charm will let you deal damage for longer if you spec your Cataclysmic the right way, and you can craft the exact roll you want. Recommended MW - Reload or Charge Time. The common thread with LFRs are: . Is it better than Reed's Regret?. Focused Fury was dismissed at first, but has turned out to be a valuable option for solo content, especially combo'd with FTTC (check out Prelapse's video on the LFR comparisons for more info).

Looking to get both Range to 80 and Stability to 70 with Masterwork, barrel, and mag traits. Cornered gives you Backup Plan-lite when near enemies, and Successful Warm-Up makes follow-up kills easier. Recommended MW: Stability with Quick Access Sling or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on play style.

//notes:For PvP linear fusions can be hit or miss (zing), they require either set up for OHK, or to lower the charge time to treat it more like a sniper. Cataclysm can get the latter to a very strong degree. Accelerated coils, charge time MW, and successful warm up will net you such a fast charge time. And with linear fusion rifles being one shot kills to the head you can have a linear that is basically a sniper rifle after that first kill. You know what? Just use a sniper rifle. Recommended MW - Charge Time. |tags:pvp,mkb,controller

//notes:Cataclysmic is an interesting linear fusion rifle [...] While it doesnt directly beat out Reeds Regret in terms of damage it possibly could. It really depends on your damage window. Firing line will do longer burst damage, but if you dont have mag extending perks you wont be able to keep up with Cataclysmic. Fourth times the charm will let you deal damage for longer if you spec your Cataclysmic the right way, and you can craft the exact roll you want. Recommended MW - Reload or Charge Time. The common thread with LFRs are: . Is it better than Reed's Regret?. Focused Fury was dismissed at first, but has turned out to be a valuable option for solo content, especially combo'd with FTTC (check out Prelapse's video on the LFR comparisons for more info). Ultimately, its nice to have more elemental options in your back pocket, as you never know what kind of synergies may come along with subclass reworks and matching mods (see: Font of Might). |tags:pve,mkb,god-pve,controller
